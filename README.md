**How to Use**
* Type in tasks one at a time in the "Enter a task..." input field
* Once you finish a task, tap on the gray circle next to the task name to mark it as completed and move it into the "Completed Items" list
* To move a completed task (in the "Completed Items" list) back up, tap again on the gray circle next to that task.

* More features, such as editing task names, deleting tasks, and local storage coming soon!
